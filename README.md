Started in a sleepless night because of being madly in love as a rewrite of my first React/Redux monstrosity:

https://davidsanwald.github.io/setsunai/

Now I use it as my playground to get into all kinds of things, which are interesting to me.
It's my playground and field of experimentation, so it's not about providing a functioning version of the app or a clean master branch at every time.
Sometimes I do unbelievable things even to the master, rebase, delete or completely mess up something. So sorry for that.

TODO
* Add some actual interface
* Further improving offline capabilities
* Adding cooler not as simplistic Pad component, that uses SVG animations instead of not repaint safe CSS properties
* Better isolation of individual unit tests
* Changing store structure, so that multiple sequencers can be handled

* ~~Testing React Storybook~~
