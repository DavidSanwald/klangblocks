    <!--
      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      <h1>No JavaScript? Flaky Connection?</h1>

  Hello it seems like there's no JavaScript activated or supported on your site. So you can't experience the interactive sound shenanigans and their colorful visualisation right now here in the browser.
  But this is the most progressive web app of all, so this site can still provide you an amazing, interactive UX. Without JavaScript/Offline and all...
  How?


  Drop me a <a href="mailto:why.ever.not.berlin@gmail.com?subject=Making music and having a good time">note</a>, make us some tea and let's come up with a good way how I could get to you're place if you're not living in Berlin.
  I will come to your place, bring my guitar (and if you want to also a Kalimba (an instrument you will be able to play right way, trust me!) so that we can start a jam session (:


  Love

  David
