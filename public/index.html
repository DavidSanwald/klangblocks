      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tag above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.

      Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
      I'm David and I made all kinds of sound and color shenanigans I wanted to share with you on this side. Unfortunately it seems like there's no JavaScript here right now. </p>
      <p>
      But don't worry. Coming together, sharing something and making music should not depend on some connection or JavaScript support.
      So just make some tea, drop me a  <a href="mailto:why.ever.not.berlin@gmail.com?subject=Making music and having a good time">note</a>.</p>
      <p>
      I'd love to come over, bring my guitar and if you want also a Kalimba for you to play (that's the instrument I'm holding on the picture) So we're ready for some Jamsession.
      If you also happen to live in Berlin, this  could be even today. But if you're somewhere else in the world, I still believe we can find a way (:
      </p>
      <p>
      Love
     </p>
     <p>
      David
